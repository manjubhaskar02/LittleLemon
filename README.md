### What I learned

Iâ€™ve just finished my coding journey on the Meta front-end developer program. By the end of this program, we can put our new skills to work by completing a real-world portfolio project, where we can create our own dynamic front-end web application. Completing this project will help us to validate the knowledge and skills that we have gained.


### Continued development

Want to focus on react more.
